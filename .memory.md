# Portfolio Project Memory

## Current State
- Created a sci-fi themed portfolio with React + Vite + Three.js
- Implemented main components:
  - Hero section with glitch text effect
  - Interactive 3D cosmic system background
  - Job experience represented as orbiting planets
  - Detailed HUD panel for job information
  - Loading screen for Suspense fallback
- Fixed TypeScript type declarations and issues in components.
- Implemented major visual enhancements:
  - Custom shader-based planets with atmospheric glow
  - Dynamic orbit trails with animated dash patterns
  - Background skill constellations with twinkling effect

## Component Structure

## Current Features
- Interactive 3D solar system with job experiences
- Hover effects on planets showing company names
- Detailed HUD panel showing job details
- Glitch text effects in Hero section
- Responsive design
- Background star field
- Orbital paths visualization
- Planet rotation and orbit animations
- Custom shader-based planet textures with atmospheric glow
- Dynamic orbit trails with animated dash patterns
- Background skill constellations with twinkling effect

## Linter Errors to Fix
- [DONE] Missing type declarations for:
   - `./components/Loading`
   - `./components/SciFiDashboard`
   - `./components/CosmicSystem`
   - `./components/JobPlanet`
   - `./components/Sun`
   - `./components/HUD`
- [DONE] Type issues in CosmicSystem.tsx:
   - `setSelectedObject` implicit any type
   - `useRef()` missing argument
   - `rotation` property type
   - `languageColors` indexing
- TypeScript issues in shader components:
   - JobPlanet component: planetMaterial JSX declaration
   - CosmicSystem component: useRef typings and meshLine JSX declarations
   - SkillConstellation component: bufferAttribute args property

## TODO
1. [DONE] Fix TypeScript type declarations
2. [DONE] Add custom 3D models for planets
3. [DONE] Implement skill constellations in background
4. Add particle effects for achievements
5. Create custom shaders for sun's corona effect
6. Add smooth transitions between planet focus
7. Implement mobile responsiveness
8. Add loading progress indicator
9. Optimize 3D scene performance
10. Add sound effects for interactions
11. Implement game-like interactions for discovering skills and masteries

## Next Steps
- Develop a game-like mechanic to discover skills and masteries
- Fix remaining TypeScript issues in shader components
- Add interaction features to skill constellations

## Visual Enhancements Planned
1. [DONE] Custom planet textures based on job roles
2. [DONE] Dynamic orbit trails
3. [DONE] Atmospheric effects for planets
4. [DONE] Constellation patterns for skills
5. Electric blue accent animations

## Game Concept Ideas
1. "Skill Discovery" - Allow users to explore and discover skills through interactions
2. Achievement unlocking system - Reveal mastery levels or "failures" as easter eggs
3. Progression-based exploration - Unlock more detailed information by navigating the cosmic system
4. Interactive skill tests - Mini-challenges that reveal skillset details

## Accessibility Improvements Needed
1. Keyboard navigation support
2. Screen reader descriptions for 3D elements
3. High contrast mode
4. Motion reduction option

## Performance Optimization Needed
1. Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for planets
2. Optimize texture sizes
3. Use instances for similar geometries
4. Implement object pooling for particles
